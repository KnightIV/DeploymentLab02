/***************************** Deployment Lab *********************************

Instructions
------------

Run the DeploymentLabSetup.sql script to create three databases representative 
of the different customer database states: DeploymentA, DeploymentB, DeploymentC.  

Due to the nature of the grading rubric for this lab, your script _must_ be able 
to execute on a single database by running the entire script with no text selected.

Make sure your entire script parses and runs!

The Scenario:
-------------

The "Deployment" (Northwind) database is deployed to hundreds of franchises worldwide, 
and it is one of several databases behind a larger application.

Each franchise owner can add and remove rows to any table in the database.  
An owner can, for example, add suppliers or products, in addition to adding 
customers, orders, and order details.  

You previously and mistakenly released a patch that inconsistently
updated customers' databases.  On some databases, the update succeeded, on others
it partially succeeded, and on others it has not run yet.

Your task is to release another patch that appropriately brings all franchise
databases up to date, regardless of how much of the previous patch was 
successful.

The DeploymentX databases are based on the TSQL2012 / Northwind database we've been using in class.

Rubric
------

I'll take your script, add a "Use DeploymentA/B/C" at the top, then run it.  Your
script should succeed on DeploymentA and B.  In DeploymentC,
which represents a database changed beyond your company's service agreement,
your script will fail and must roll back any changes it made previous to the failure
point.

After running your script on the three databases, I'll run an automated test 
to ensure the script successfully completed all the tasks in each question for A and B, 
and successfully rolled back on C.

This is what "all succeed or all fail" or "atomicity" means.

You earn points by completing/rolling back gracefully and handling expected database 
differences described in each question.
